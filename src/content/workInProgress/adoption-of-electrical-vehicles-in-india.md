title: 'Third Way of Green Transition: Adoption of Electric Vehicles in India'
abstract: 'There is a growing literature on electric vehicles (EVs) adoption in developed countries, but not much discussion on what that transition path would be for the developing world. The transportation sector in India is characterized by a wide variety of vehicles (two-wheelers, three-wheelers, etc.) with different ownership structure and driving usage. Combining the vehicle registration dataset with measures of pollution, traffic congestion and government subsidies, we explore the effect of subsidies on EV adoption and environment outcomes in India. We use a quantitative framework to explore how complementary policies, such as congestion zones and charging station subsidies, could better facilitate the green transition. We emphasize a unique channel that can contribute to a better understanding of the environmental effects of EV adoption policies in developing countries: a reduction in clean vehicle price due to subsidies could increase vehicle ownership and therefore lead to more traffic congestion. Gasoline vehicle drivers will spend more time on the road generating higher pollution. The overall environmental benefits from EV subsidies will crucially depend on the ownership effect and the speed of substitution from dirty to clean vehicles.'
