title: 'Accounting for the Unaccounted: Street Vendors in India'
abstract: '93 percent of 2 billion informal workers in the world are concentrated in low-and middle-income countries. This is partly a consequence of rural-to-urban migration in the face of deindustrialization and lack of formal job opportunities. This results in excess labor in urban areas absorbed by informal activities such as street vending. Though highly visible, street vendors are the most unaccounted form of informal employment after home based workers. In this project, we plan to map the allocation of natural markets within a city in order to understand how they interact with the built environment and we plan to systematically collect new data on this subset of informal workers in one city in India through a survey.  This data will help us address important economic questions related to occupational choice, organization of street vendors within marketplaces and the role of social networks in the operation of these markets, supply chain networks and constraints to upward mobility. The project aims to understand the economic choices of street vendors better by 1) bridging the data gap and 2) creating a baseline to design interventions relaxing the constraints to upward mobility or formalization in the future.'
